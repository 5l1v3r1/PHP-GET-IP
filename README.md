# POC 
- This is my second contribution in `GitHub`, I wanted to share with you guys a simple PHP script that can save IPs into .TXT file, All what do you need is to upload this script into a server.
- for example:
 www.mysite.com/ip.php 
- you send it to your friend for example üòÇ.
Once your friend visit that link his IP will be recorded on that server under this name " ip.txt ".
-www.mysite.com/ip.txt 
- THE DANGEROUS THING IS THAT YOU CAN SIMPLY KNOW HIS IP IS SUFFICIENT TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK üèπ USING METASPLOIT TOOLS. üåπüåπüåπ
